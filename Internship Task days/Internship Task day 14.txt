Create a class Employee with name and salary attributes.

The salary has to be calculated and should be initialized to zero.
Create a method to calculate the salary by taking the no of hours worked and multiply it by 200.You can give no of hours to the method as an argument.

Now create a child class ParttimeEmployee by inheriting the Employee class, and by using method overriding (create salary calculation method in this class also with the same name)
get the salary of part time employee by multiplyig no of hours worked by 150.

Create 3 objects for each class.
Now implement '+' operator overloading and find the total salary expense for keeping those employees by adding up the objects together.

Eg:

e1 = Employee(name="John")
e1.update_salary(hours=8)

e2 = Employee(name="Robin")
e2.update_salary(hours=8)

e3 = PartTimeEmployee(name="Jake")
e3.update_salary(hours=8)

# The below line should work.
total_expense = e1 + e2 + e3
